# C - Binary trees

This is a partner project in which we are learning about the details, advantages,
and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. We are learning about how to
qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, we are working on 
implementing binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
